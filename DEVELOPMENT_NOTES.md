# Claude Code Windows Installer - Development Notes

## Phase 1 Implementation Learnings (June 2024)

### Key Technical Insights

#### 1. Cross-Platform Development Strategy
**Challenge**: Developing Windows installer on Linux/NixOS
**Solution**: Nix-shell environment with NSIS, PowerShell Core, and mock testing
- NSIS works perfectly on Linux for building Windows installers
- PowerShell Core provides excellent cross-platform compatibility
- Mock testing strategy allows development without Windows

**Key Learning**: The cross-platform development approach is viable and actually provides better reproducibility than developing directly on Windows.

#### 2. Dependency Detection Architecture
**Challenge**: Detecting dependencies across Windows and WSL environments
**Implementation**: Multi-layer detection system
```javascript
// Pattern that works well:
async detectNodeJS(config) {
  const results = { windows: null, wsl: null };
  // Check both environments independently
  // Determine best available version
  // Return unified result with location info
}
```

**Critical Insights**:
- Always check both Windows and WSL environments separately
- Use version comparison for compatibility, not just existence checks
- Provide clear "location" information (Windows vs WSL vs None)
- Never assume tools exist - graceful error handling is essential

#### 3. PowerShell Module Design Patterns
**Best Practices Discovered**:
```powershell
# Always use error handling
Set-StrictMode -Version Latest
$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'

# Comprehensive logging pattern
function Write-Log {
    param([string]$Message, [string]$Level = 'Info')
    # Both console and file logging
}

# System validation pattern
function Test-SystemRequirements {
    # Return hashtable with Pass/Fail and detailed info
    return @{
        WindowsVersion = Test-WindowsVersion
        Architecture = Test-Architecture
        # ... other checks
        OverallResult = @{ Passed = $allPassed }
    }
}
```

**Key Learning**: PowerShell modules should return structured data (hashtables) rather than just success/failure, enabling better error reporting and decision making.

#### 4. NSIS Integration Challenges
**Challenge**: Integrating PowerShell execution with NSIS UI
**Solution**: nsExec plugin with JSON output parsing
```nsis
; Pattern that works:
nsExec::ExecToStack 'powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "..."'
Pop $0 ; Exit code
Pop $1 ; Output (can be JSON)
```

**Critical Insights**:
- NSIS variables are global - be careful with naming
- Use JSON for complex data exchange between PowerShell and NSIS
- Progress updates require careful UI thread management
- Always handle PowerShell execution failures gracefully

#### 5. Alpine Linux Setup Best Practices
**Pattern for Tool Installation**:
```bash
# Always check before installing
command_exists curl || tools_to_install+=("curl")

# Version-aware installation
if command_exists node; then
    current_version=$(node --version | sed 's/v//')
    if version_ge "$current_version" "$REQUIRED_VERSION"; then
        echo "Compatible version found, skipping"
        return 0
    fi
fi
```

**Key Learning**: The "check-then-install" pattern prevents unnecessary package operations and respects existing user configurations.

### Architecture Decisions That Worked

#### 1. Modular Language Separation
- **JavaScript**: Dependency detection and validation logic
- **PowerShell**: Windows system operations and WSL management  
- **Bash**: Alpine Linux configuration and environment setup
- **NSIS**: UI and installer orchestration

**Why This Works**: Each language handles what it's best at, with clear interfaces between components.

#### 2. Configuration-Driven Design
**Central configuration** (`defaults.json`) for:
- Version requirements and compatibility matrix
- Installation phases and timing estimates
- UI text and error messages
- Registry and shortcut configurations

**Key Learning**: Having a single source of truth for configuration makes the installer much easier to maintain and customize.

#### 3. Non-Destructive Installation Philosophy
**Core Principle**: Never break existing user setups
- Detect existing installations before proceeding
- Skip compatible versions rather than upgrading
- Use isolated environments (WSL) when possible
- Provide clear communication about what will/won't be installed

**Impact**: This approach builds user trust and prevents support issues.

### Testing Strategy Insights

#### 1. Unit Testing Challenges
**Challenge**: Mocking child_process.exec with promisify
**Learning**: Complex mocking scenarios are difficult to maintain
**Better Approach**: Focus on integration testing with real command execution

#### 2. Development Testing
**Effective Pattern**: 
```bash
# Test individual components
node src/scripts/validation/dependency-detector.js

# Test in development environment
nix-shell --run "make dev-setup"
```

**Key Learning**: Direct component testing is more valuable than complex unit test mocking during development phase.

### Build System Learnings

#### 1. Nix Shell Configuration
**Working Pattern**:
```nix
buildInputs = with pkgs; [
  nsis powershell nodejs gnumake
  # Avoid unfree packages like vscode in shared configs
];
```

**Key Learning**: Keep the development environment minimal and reproducible. Developers can add their own tools.

#### 2. Makefile Organization
**Effective Structure**:
- `dev-setup`: Environment validation
- `prepare`: Build directory setup
- `build`: NSIS compilation
- `test`: Run test suite
- `clean`: Cleanup

**Key Learning**: Clear, single-purpose targets make the build system approachable for new contributors.

### User Experience Insights

#### 1. Progress Communication
**Effective Pattern**:
```
✓ WSL2 - Compatible version found
  Version: WSL 2.0.9.0
  Status: Will use existing

❌ Claude Code - Not installed
  Status: Will install

Estimated time: 3-5 minutes (Reduced due to existing deps)
```

**Key Learning**: Users want to understand what's happening and why. Clear status with explanations builds confidence.

#### 2. Error Message Design
**Effective Pattern**:
```json
{
  "1003": {
    "title": "Administrator Privileges Required",
    "description": "This installer must be run with administrator privileges",
    "solution": "Right-click the installer and select 'Run as administrator'"
  }
}
```

**Key Learning**: Error messages need three components: what happened, why it matters, and what to do about it.

### Challenges for Next Phases

#### 1. Reboot Handling
**Complexity**: WSL2 installation may require reboot mid-installation
**Strategy**: Scheduled task continuation with state preservation
**Testing Need**: Reboot scenarios require real Windows testing

#### 2. Antivirus Interaction
**Risk**: NSIS installers often trigger false positives
**Mitigation Needed**: Code signing, vendor communication, exclusion documentation
**Testing Need**: Multiple antivirus products

#### 3. Corporate Environment Compatibility
**Challenges**: Group policies, proxy servers, restricted user accounts
**Strategy**: Comprehensive environment detection and graceful degradation
**Testing Need**: Domain-joined corporate machines
